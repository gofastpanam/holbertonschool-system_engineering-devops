ISSUES ======>
-> SPOF: means 'Single Point of Failure'. If a component is failing to work it is entire system that fails. 

-> Downtime When Maintenance Needed: Sometimes we have to inject new code to a program and it needs a restart of the server. 

-> Cannot Scale if Too Much Incoming Traffic: If the infrastructure cannot handle increased traffic, it means the system lacks the capability to scale horizontally or vertically to manage higher loads.
