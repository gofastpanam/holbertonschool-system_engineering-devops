HAproxy (Load Balancer):

=> To distribute incoming traffic across multiple web servers to balance the load and improve reliability. It ensures high availability by managing traffic and providing failover capabilities in case of server failures.

Web Server (one and two in our case):

=> To handle HTTP requests and serve static content (e.g., HTML files, images). It ensures that users can access the web application and its resources efficiently.

Application Server:

=> To process the business logic of the application. It handles dynamic content and performs tasks such as data processing, user authentication, and application logic execution.

Database Server:

=> To store and manage the application's data. It provides a structured way to store, retrieve, and manipulate data used by the application server.
